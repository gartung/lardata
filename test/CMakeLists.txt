# various integration tests

# these tests run a FCL file and fail only if lar exits with a bad exit code;
# they are fast and always run.
# FCL files need to be copied to the test area (DATAFILES directive) since they
# are not installed.
# OPTIONAL_GROUPS is set to execute the test in the "BROKEN" test suite;
# that is because this test is currently failing for MicroBooNE
